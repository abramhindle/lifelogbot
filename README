Life Log Bot
============

Life Log Bot is an attempt to create a personal agent. 

Life Log Bot will:

* Record messages sent to it
* Record messages in org format
* Ping you every so often and ask what you are doing
* Aggregate messages into 10 minute chunks.
* Schedule harassment
* Allow interaction via IRC
* Allow interaction via Jabber (google-talk)
* Email a report every-day [done via schedule]

Life Log Bot will eventually:

* TODO: Write out to a database to allow the bot to restart
* TODO: Write out schedule to allow saving of schedules to disk
* TODO: Write messages after 10 minutes 
* TODO: Refactor the commands into something more coherent
* TODO: Add more commands and markups
* TODO: calendar sync
* TODO: Make default config a global singleton 

How do I use it?
================

I use my android phone to talk to Life Log Bot over google talk and use the
speech to text interface to dictate notes.

Sometimes I use it on IRC. IRC is nice because it is easy to run your
own server. Note for IRC, irssi proxy might work.

Note, in both cases a 3rd party can listen in. I don't have OTR

Commands
========

.c say broadcast this message

   Broadcasts "broadcast this message" across IRC and Jabber

.c say email DO THIS NOW!
   
   Emails your account a message saying DO THIS NOW!
   Useful for any adhoc automation

.c save
   
   Save your message out to the log

.c dailyreport

   Bundle up a dailyreport and email it to yourself

.c schedule weekly [1234567]+ [012][0-9]:[0-5][0-9] commandname commandargs

   Schedule days of week at a certain time to execute command with commandargs
   - Good for repeating reminders with say or email

.c schedule weekly 23456 10:00 say What's up?

   Example schedule of Monday to Friday 10am messaging the accounts "What's up?"

.c schedule daily [012][0-9]:[0-5][0-9] commandname commandargs
.c schedule daily 12:00 dailyreport

   Example schedule of a dailyreport at noon

Configuration
=============

* Check this out,
* mkdir config
* cp config.json.default config/config.json
* edit config/config.json

Configure Jabber and IRC accounts. You'll need to make an account for the bot.



In this day and age where everyone wants your information wouldn't it
be nice to have some control over yourself.
