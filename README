Life Log Bot
============

Life Log Bot is an attempt to create a personal agent. 

Life Log Bot will:

* Record messages sent to it
* Record messages in org format
* Ping you every so often and ask what you are doing
* Aggregate messages into 10 minute chunks.
* Schedule harassment
* Allow interaction via IRC
* Allow interaction via Jabber (google-talk)

Life Log Bot will eventually:

* TODO: Write messages after 10 minutes 
* TODO: Email a report everyday
* TODO: Refactor the commands into something more coherent
* TODO: Add more commands and markups
* TODO: calendar sync

How do I use it?
================

I use my android phone to talk to Life Log Bot over google talk and use the
speech to text interface to dictate notes.

Sometimes I use it on IRC. IRC is nice because it is easy to run your
own server. Note for IRC, irssi proxy might work.

Note, in both cases a 3rd party can listen in. I don't have OTR

Configuration
=============

* Check this out,
* mkdir config
* cp config.json.default config/config.json
* edit config/config.json

Configure Jabber and IRC accounts. You'll need to make an account for the bot.



In this day and age where everyone wants your information wouldn't it
be nice to have some control over yourself.
